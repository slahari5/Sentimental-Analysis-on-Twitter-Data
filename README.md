# Twitter Application

 A model was developed to estimate the emotion of a tweet (the model was trained in google colab). The model was saved, and predictions were made using the flask framework. Every time a user does a search in the user interface, the system actually retrieves relevant tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API and then informs us of the tweets' positivity, negativity, or neutrality.
